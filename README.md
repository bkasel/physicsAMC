## Introduction

This projects seeks to create an exam question repository for an introductory physics course.
If you are not convinced in the effectiveness of multiple choice,
    I would strongly recommend [Scott2006](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevSTPER.2.020102).

This project should be of interest to anyone who teaches a physics course,
    and especially to anyone whose students take the NYSED physics regents.
I am also aware that most online solutions are simply not an option for many high school teachers.


My main goals are to bring some basic ideas from computer science to teaching.


## Dependencies

- [automultiplechoice](http://home.gna.org/auto-qcm/), this should really be self explanatory, hence the AMC in the project name.
- [mhchem](http://ctan.org/pkg/mhche) is used for typsetting nuclear reactions.
- [pgfplots](http://ctan.org/pkg/pgfplots) is used extensively for all graphs.
- [circuitikz](http://ctan.org/pkg/circuitikz) is used for all circuit diagrams.
- [pgf/TikZ](http://ctan.org/pkg/pgf) is used extensively for all graphics.
- [lualatex](http://luatex.org/) is used for unicode font support and for integrating lua scripts into documents
- [siunitx](http://ctan.org/pkg/siunitx) is used for typsetting all SI units and most other units and numbers.
- [amsmath](http://ctan.org/pkg/amsmath) is used for typsetting all equations.
- [booktabs](http://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs) is used for typesetting tables.
- [tabu](http://ctan.org/pkg/tabu) is used for creating column fitted tables.
