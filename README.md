#physicsAMC

## Introduction

This projects seeks to create a complete repository for an introductory physics course.

I want technology in the background, not foreground.

Most online solutions are simply not an option for many high school teachers.


* What the project does
* Whom it's for
* On what hardware or other platform it runs
* Any major dependencies, such as &ldquo;Requires Python 2.6 and libxml&rdquo;
* How to install it, or a pointer to in-depth directions


## Why Use Multiple Choice Exams?

[@Scott2006]:

## Dependencies

- [automultiplechoice](http://home.gna.org/auto-qcm/), this should really be self explanatory, hence the AMC in the project name.
- [mhchem](http://ctan.org/pkg/mhche) is used for typsetting nuclear reactions.
- [pgfplots](http://ctan.org/pkg/pgfplots) is used extensively for all graphs.
- [circuitikz](http://ctan.org/pkg/circuitikz) is used for all circuit diagrams.
- [pgf/TikZ](http://ctan.org/pkg/pgf) is used extensively for all graphics.
- [lua](http://lua.org) and [lualatex](http://luatex.org/) are mainly used for creating in question randomization.
- [siunitx](http://ctan.org/pkg/siunitx) is used for typsetting all SI units and most other units and numbers.
- [amsmath](http://ctan.org/pkg/amsmath) is used for typsetting all equations.
- [booktabs](http://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs) is used for typesetting tables.
- [tabu](http://ctan.org/pkg/tabu) is used for creating column fitted tables.
