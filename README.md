## introduction

You should be able to copy and past this directory directly into your MC-Project directory.
I have included one example exam with each template.
Do not print or use the sample exam included,
    as you must compile it yourself for grading.

## templates

- [kinematics exam](kinematics-exam), an example kinematics exam, utilizing my custom graph questions with NYSED and AAPT Physics Bowl questions.
    The exam includes a cover sheet with a response and reference sheet at the end.

- [kinematics full quiz](kinematics-full), an example full page kinematics exam utilizing my custom unit questions (requires lua!) with NYSED questions. 
    This exam does not include a cover sheet with instructions or a response and reference sheet at the end.

- [kinematics half quiz](kinematics-half), an exmaple half page kinematics exam utilizing just NYSED questions.
    This exam is desinged to be as space efficient as possible.
