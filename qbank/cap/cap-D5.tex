\begin{question}{CAP-A-2013-q03}
    A long, straight wire carries a current that decreases linearly with time. 
    What is the direction of the induced electric field outside the wire?
    \begin{choices}
      \correctchoice{Parallel to the current in the wire, in the same direction.}
        \wrongchoice{Parallel to the current in the wire, in the opposite direction.}
        \wrongchoice{Pointing radially outward from the wire.}
        \wrongchoice{Pointing radially inward toward the wire.}
        \wrongchoice{There is no induced electric field outside the wire.}
    \end{choices}

\begin{question}{CAP-A-2013-q25}
    An electromagnetic wave is propagating in vacuum in the positive $z$ direction. 
    At an instant when its magnetic field $B$ at a certain position is in the positive $x$ direction and getting stronger,
        what happens to its electric field $E$ at that same position?
    \begin{choices}
        \wrongchoice{$E$ is in the positive $x$ direction and getting weaker.}
        \wrongchoice{$E$ is in the negative $x$ direction and getting stronger.}
        \wrongchoice{$E$ is in the positive $y$ direction and getting weaker.}
      \correctchoice{$E$ is in the negative $y$ direction and getting stronger.}
        \wrongchoice{$E$ is zero.}
    \end{choices}
